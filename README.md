# Generalized Intuitionistic Fuzzy Soft Sets (GIFSS)

## Overview
This repository documents my **Master’s thesis research** titled:

**“Generalized Intuitionistic Fuzzy Soft Sets and Its Applications”**

The work focuses on mathematical frameworks for modeling **uncertainty, vagueness, and imprecision** in decision-making systems.

---

## Research Context
Classical probabilistic models often fail to capture ambiguity in real-world data.
Fuzzy and soft set theories provide alternative mathematical tools for uncertainty modeling.

---

## Contributions
- Formal definition of generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets
- Development of mathematical properties and operations
- Application to multi-criteria decision-making problems

---

## Research Significance
This thesis forms the theoretical foundation for my interest in:
- Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)
- Interpretable models
- Scientific and data-driven decision systems

---

## Status
This repository serves as a **research archive**.
Full thesis material and selected derivations will be added progressively.

---

## Academic Integrity
This work was completed as part of the M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics at IIEST Shibpur.
